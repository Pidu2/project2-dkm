BaTh:
- Kind of a similar use case: different keys are generated and then “merged” together to get one key
- In their thesis, there seem to always be an exact number of keys to restore “the one” key. We talked about having the possibility to restore the key with e.g. 3 out of 5 keys.

Book:
- The book does not yet have the chapters that would be most interesting for us (DKM: Introduction, Key regeneration, Key rotation, Key recovery)
- Still, parts of it should probably be read to have a good idea of SSI in general and how a DKM needs to be built to support it

Evernym and Sovrin:
- Funded with the money from U.S. Department of Homeland Security

Key recovery:
- Shamir secret sharing scheme -> Hyperledger Indy
- Threshold signature scheme -> Binance

Open:
- DKMS all of it or only key recovery (etc.)?
- SSI / DKMS -> SSI how deep? Key recovery only SSI? 
- Decentralized vs. distributed (naming)
- NuCypher example (called DKMS), what's this?
- Swisscom connections?

Document layout:
- Introduction
- Explain SSI 
- Different Technologies (basic technologies for key recovery)
- Key Recovery (actual usage of one of these technologies)
- Summary

Wording:
- DID (decentralized identifier)
- DDO (DID descriptor object, documents (infos) referenced by DID)
