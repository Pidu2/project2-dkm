Solutions for private key recovery:
- Mnemonic / Seed phrase: Is a series of words that can cryptographically derive a private key. Used for Ethereum and Binance.
- Social Recovery: Group of friends are able to recover access to the lost account. Used for WeChat. (SSS)
- Paralysis Proofs: Multisig-scheme and one looses a key. Recover this key by proving that the key is lost. -> not really usable for SSI..?
